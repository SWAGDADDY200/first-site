    <p class="fromthing">From 2002, I(George Geovani) and my father(Davin Geovani) have been driving, collecting, selling, racing and talking about cars,  we just can't get enough on cars, me and my father have toured <br>
        the world driving these exotic cars and after all these years we still cant get enough, especially with a new car almost every year. It is truley beautiful
        but for a time now we have thought to get a <br>feel for our  tech side, so had an idea to make a 
        website for super and hypercar lover's, with all the specs, lap times, and more....
